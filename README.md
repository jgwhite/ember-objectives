# iSpy

A rough prototype for an IRL game in which participants volunteer themselves
as “spies” and let “controllers” direct their motions. Think murder-mystery
party meets speed dating, but real time and city wide, then colour in the
rest yourself.

Built with [Ember][ember], [Simperium][simperium], [Moment][moment]
and [Foundation][foundation] at the [Ember London Hackathon][elh] in May 2013.
